  - Difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Difficult.
  - Limited attempts based on the chosen difficulty.
  - Error handling for invalid input.
  - Replayability option after completing the game.

## Program No. 2 - Simple Calculator

**Description:**
- **File Name:** `SimpleCalculator.cpp`
- **Functionality:** This program acts as a simple calculator allowing users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on floating-point numbers. Users input two numbers and select an operation, and the program displays the result.
- **Features:**
  - Support for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  - Error handling for invalid input and division by zero.
  - Option to perform multiple calculations in succession.

## Program No. 3 - Tic Tac Toe Game

**Description:**
- **File Name:** `TicTacToe.cpp`
- **Functionality:** The classic Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C++. Two players (X and O) take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to achieve three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. The game ends when one player wins or the grid fills up, resulting in a draw.
- **Features:**
  - Interactive board display.
  - Player input validation to ensure moves are within the grid and on unoccupied spaces.
  - Win detection for rows, columns, and diagonals.
  - Option for players to replay the game.
